# ledsr
led panel driver using TPIC6B595 shift registers. For "Greg's Cockpit"

# NOTE ABOUT THE FILES
 - You will probably need to jump JP1 to power up the chip, if you want to run the same voltage for the logic and the driver voltage.
 - You can use the G pin if you want, but, you can probably just ground it. (We are just grounding it.) If left floating you could see random clears of the LEDs.
